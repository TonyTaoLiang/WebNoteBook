    The Adaptive Sections example shows how to create a layout that adapts to the environment it’s displayed in. In this example, the number of columns shown changes based on the available screen size. Creating a layout that adapts to a new environment requires a compositional layout with a section provider. The code in the section provider accesses the amount of available space in the current layout environment (layoutEnvironment.container.effectiveContentSize), and displays a different number of columns based on the available width.
